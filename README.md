# Dry-Bean-Dataset-Machine-Learning
# Introduction
The Dry Beans Dataset is a available dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.Images of 13,611 grains of 7 different registered dry beans were taken with a high-resolution camera. A total of 16 features; 12 dimensions and 4 shape forms, were obtained from the grains. Seven different types of dry beans were used in this research, taking into account the features such as form, shape, type, and structure by the market situation. A computer vision system was developed to distinguish seven different registered varieties of dry beans with similar features in order to obtain uniform seed classification. For the classification model, images of 13,611 grains of 7 different registered dry beans were taken with a high-resolution camera. Bean images obtained by computer vision system were subjected to segmentation and feature extraction stages, and a total of 16 features; 12 dimensions and 4 shape forms, were obtained from the grains.
# Objective
The Dry Beans Dataset is designed for multi-class classification, utilizing shape and size features to distinguish between different types of dry beans. It contains various geometric properties of dry beans, with the primary goal is to predict the class of a given bean sample based on these characteristics.
